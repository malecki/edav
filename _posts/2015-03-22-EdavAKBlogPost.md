A link to my previous chart project with Cathy getting NYPD Vehicla Crash data where we used RMartdown with R embedded code using ggplo2 has output [Getting data into browser using R ](../2015-02-24-rMarkdown_ggplot_knitr.html). 

An image, located where we had used R package rCharts and converted the same data into an interactive charts.

* Here are major bullet points for this blog:
  + Create a page that can have Text, Links, enbedded images, possibly some R Code
  + Image and link to the chart and data that is not using the best visualization approach.  
    - Chart is not conveying the message correctly.
    - Supporting data is sufficient to convey the correct message and problem exists due to mis representation of the data.
  + Image of an improved visualization.

>> Nested Blockquote

Syntax highlighting can be used with triple backticks, like so:

```javascript
/* Some pointless Javascript */
var rawr = ["r", "a", "w", "r"];
```

Use two trailing spaces  
on the right  
to create linebreak tags  

Finally, horizontal lines
