#### The graph is misleading as it does not take into account following two key points. 

  1. Graph does not show the decrease in earnings potential for a high school graduate in comparison with the college graduate.
  1. Graph also fails to compare the cummulative life time earnings at various education levels that will truly depict Return on Investment of education.

#### Improvement:

  1. Earning potentials need to be shown between different education levels. 
  1. Return on Investments needs to take cummulative earnings and future earnings potential.

#### Following chart (Source: The U.S. Department of Education) shows lifetime earnings among different education levels.
Comparing this to the education expense shows that there is a net positive return.
### The more the Education the higher the Return.
